## About the project

1. **What is the task?** 
- Menu driven program demonstrating CRUD functions
2. **What was learned?** 
- Learned how to be more clear in a case diagram. Specifically, I was thinking about how the plant would need to be put in a list and how I would show that in a case diagram. But, that is a backwards way of thinking about it. It should be actor and case driven.
- Learned about the different ways to view sorted objects in a list. It was difficult at first. I had some difficulties sorting an object by its field properties. Learning a little about lambda expression really aided in that.

## Use Case Diagram

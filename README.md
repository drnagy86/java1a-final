## About the project

1. **What is the task?** 
- Menu driven program demonstrating CRUD functions
2. **What was learned?** 
- Learned how to be more clear in a case diagram. Specifically, I was thinking about how the plant would need to be put in a list and how I would show that in a case diagram. But, that is a backwards way of thinking about it. It should be actor and case driven.

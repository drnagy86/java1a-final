## About the project

1. **What is the task?** 
- A menu driven program demonstrating CRUD functions
2. **What was learned?** 
- Learned how to be more clear in a case diagram. Specifically, I was thinking about how the plant would need to be put in a list and how I would show that in a case diagram. But, that is a backwards way of thinking about it. It should be actor and case driven.
- Learned about the different ways to view sorted objects in a list. It was difficult at first. I had some difficulties sorting an object by its field properties. Learning a little about lambda expression really aided in that.
- Getting a better understanding of an overwritten string method. I also had an epiphany about how the example was done in JSON format. That makes sense from a perspective of where the course is leading us and how that would be useful when creating a website.
- Learned about how the implementation doesn't always follow the initial plan. I got experience with solving a problem one way and then learning how there could be a better way. Or even that the way that I thought it should be solved didn’t work the way I had intended and learning the correct way to do it.
